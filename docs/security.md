WordPlate makes your WordPress site more secure out of the box. WordPlate comes with the [`wp-password-bcrypt`](https://github.com/roots/wp-password-bcrypt#readme) package to replace WordPress's outdated and insecure [MD5-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5) password hashing with the modern and secure [bcrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt).

We recommend taking a look at the [Soil plugin](https://roots.io/plugins/soil) by [Roots](https://roots.io). It is a WordPress plugin which contains a collection of modules to apply theme-agnostic front-end modifications. The plugin also address some security concerns for WordPress themes.

We suggest [reading this article](https://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/keeping-wordpress-secure-the-ultimate-guide) to learn more about [theme security](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/theme-security) in WordPress.
