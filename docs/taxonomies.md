## Taxonomies

For [taxonomies](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/taxonomies) we recommend looking at [Extended Taxonomies
](https://github.com/johnbillion/extended-taxos#readme) by [John Blackbourn](https://github.com/johnbillion). The package provides extended functionality to WordPress custom taxonomies, allowing developers to quickly build custom taxonomies without having to write the same code again and again.

```php
register_extended_taxonomy('location', 'event');
```
