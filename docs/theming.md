> A WordPress theme changes the design of your website, often including its layout. Changing your theme changes how your site looks on the front-end, i.e. what a visitor sees when they browse to your site on the web. There are thousands of free WordPress themes in the WordPress.org Theme Directory, though many WordPress sites use custom themes - [WordPress](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/getting-started/what-is-a-theme)

Building your theme with WordPlate works like any other WordPress environment. All available WordPress classes and helper functions are available in WordPlate as well. Please visit the official [WordPress documentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes) for reference.
