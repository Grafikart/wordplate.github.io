For [custom post types](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/post-types/registering-custom-post-types) we recommend looking at [Extended CPTs](https://github.com/johnbillion/extended-cpts#readme) by [John Blackbourn](https://github.com/johnbillion). The package provides extended functionality to WordPress custom post types, allowing developers to quickly build post types without having to write the same code again and again.

```php
register_extended_post_type('event');
```
